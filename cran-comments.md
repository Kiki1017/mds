## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, and 1 NOTE.
NOTE: Non-standard directory 'revdep' found at top level. Auto-created by the revdepcheck package when running revdep_check().

## R CRAN web check results
There was 1 NOTE: 2 marked UTF-8 strings in data.
The strings in question are unimportant and serve the greater purpose of a context-releveant, open-source sample dataset.

## Downstream dependencies
I have run R CMD check on downstream dependency mdsstat and the package passed.
